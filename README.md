# Weather-app
Developed a responsive Weather Application that provides real-time weather information based on user- searched locations. 
Integrated a third-party Weather API to fetch live data such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather
conditions.
Implemented asynchronous JavaScript (Fetch API) to handle API requests and dynamically update the UI
without page reloads.
Designed a mobile-friendly interface using modern CSS techniques, including Flexbox and media queries.
Added error handling for invalid city names and network issues to enhance user experience.
